We sucessfully implemented the required set of instructions namely, bne, beq, blez, bgtz, j, jal and jr.
There are three initial states followed by an execution state and then a done state. The instructions are all pipelined so, each normal instruction takes one cycle each. The stack was also implemented by making a stack pointer and initializing it to 4096 so that it grows downwards.
The major change we made to the previous assignment was to introduce pipeline and make an additional branch delay state.
